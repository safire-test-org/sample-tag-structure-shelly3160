<h1>The Wizard of Oz</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chapter 3.  How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow</h2>
<p>Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds.</p>
<p>Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p>
<p>&quot;They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,&quot; she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.</p>
<p>At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.  &quot;I wonder if they will fit me,&quot; she said to Toto.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.&quot;</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.</p>
<h2>Finally, she picked up her basket.</h2>
<p>&rdquo;Come along, Toto,&quot; she said.  &quot;We will go to the Emerald City and ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.&quot;</p>
<p>She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress.  And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.</p>
<p>There were several roads near by, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks.  Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed.  The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She was surprised</h2>
<p>… as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her.  There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance.  Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops.  Once in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage.  The houses of the Munchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color.</p>
<p>Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest.  On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing.  Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.</p>
<p>The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.</p>
<p>Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself, whose name was Boq.  Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.</p>
<p>When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, &quot;You must be a great sorceress.&quot;</p>
